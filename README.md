# .ini-Reader
Class to read .ini-Files without the need of an additional framework from a company. 

This class is used in my Discord Bot. I needed to create this class because my configuration is stored inside a .ini file. 

I uploaded the class to a public repo because I think this could help others too.

Please feel free to improve the code.

I used ChatGPT for the base idea and improved the result.
